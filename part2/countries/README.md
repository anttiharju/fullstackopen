To see weather information, you need to create file `.env.local` that supplies an OpenWeather API key via `VITE_OPEN_WEATHER=`. Vite loads values starting with `VITE_` automatically, you do not need to supply it via an export. If you're logged in at https://openweathermap.org/, you can access API keys at https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.
